# Online-eBook-Store

An online bookstore is a web application that allows customers to buy books 
online. Customers can search for a book by title or author using a web browser, 
add it to their shopping cart, and then purchase it using a debit or credit card 
transaction. The user can log in using his or her account information, or new 
customers can swiftly create an account. They should include their full name, 
phone number, and shipping address. A user can also provide feedback to a book 
by rating it on a scale of one to five. The books are organized into several 
categories based on the subject matter, such as Action and Adventure, Classics, 
Fantasy, Fiction, Non-fiction, Horror, etc.
Customers can shop online for books at the Online Book Store using a web 
browser. A customer can create an account, sign in, add items to a shopping cart, 
and make purchases using his or her debit/credit card information. When 
compared to a regular user, the Administrator will have more features. The 
Administrator can add, delete, and edit book data, and member information, as 
well as confirm an order that has been placed.
